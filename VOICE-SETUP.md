# Voice-to-text (insanely-fast-whisper backend)

The **mic button** in the chat input sends recorded audio to a **local Python server** that uses the same stack as insanely-fast-whisper (Transformers + Whisper). No browser-based speech recognition.

## 1. Run the voice server

From the project folder:

```bash
cd voice-server
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS; on Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8765
```

See **voice-server/README.md** for details (smaller model, limits, options).

## 2. Use the mic in ATOM Code

- Start the app: `./start-atom-code.sh` (or `npm run dev` for frontend only).
- Open **Settings** → **Voice-to-text server** should be `http://localhost:8765` (default).
- In the chat input bar, click the **mic** (🎤). Click again to stop recording; the server will transcribe and insert text into the input.

## 3. If something goes wrong

- **Mic shows an error:** Make sure the voice server is running on port 8765 and the URL in Settings is correct.
- **Server OOM / crash:** Use a smaller model: `set WHISPER_MODEL=openai/whisper-base` (see voice-server/README.md).
- **Revert the whole voice feature:**  
  Git was marked before adding voice. To go back:
  ```bash
  git log --oneline
  git reset --hard <REVERT_POINT_COMMIT>
  ```
  The revert-point commit message is: **"REVERT POINT: before voice-to-text (insanely-fast-whisper). Revert to this if voice feature causes issues."**
